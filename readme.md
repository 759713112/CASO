This source code is a simple implementation to evaluate the *correlation-aware stripe organization* (CASO) in erasure-coded storage systems. Please refer to the conference paper: *Correlation-Aware Stripe Organization for Efficient Writes in Erasure-Coded Storage Systems* (in Proceedings of 36th IEEE International Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS 2017) ) for more details.  

Please refer to the **readme.pdf** for the information about the installation and running of CASO.
